<center> <h1>Quality models proposed by McCall and Boehm </h1> </center>

| Quality Model | Operation | Maintainability | Flexibility |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| McCall | Evaluates the performance of the software during its execution and its ability to perform the required functions. | Focuses on the ease with which the software can be modified, corrected or improved over time. | Measures the ability of the software to adapt to changes in requirements or in the environment. |
| Boehm | Focused on the accuracy and correctness of the software in the execution of its functions. | Evaluates the consistency and reliability of the software in various situations and environments. | Refers to the performance of the software and the optimization of resources during its execution. |
